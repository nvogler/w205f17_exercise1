MeasureID	Score	Survey Responses


What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

For each hospital
SELECT a.providerid, b.avgmeasure
FROM hospitals_formatted AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN 
find average of all measure scores

sort by avgmeasure



SELECT avg(score) as Score, a.providerid
FROM hospitals_formatted AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN readmissions_formatted AS b ON a.providerid = b.providerid
GROUP BY providerid
ORDER BY AvgBaseScore DESC limit 10;

What states are models of high-quality care?

SELECT avg(score) AS AvgScore, measureid
FROM readmission_formatted
GROUP BY measureid;

SELECT avg(AvgScore) AS AvgMeasureScore, , 

SELECT avg(BaseScore + consistencyscore) as AvgBaseScore, State
FROM hospitals_formatted AS a LEFT OUTER JOIN survey_responses_formatted AS b ON a.providerid = b.providerid
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY AvgBaseScore DESC limit 10;

Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

SELECT higherestimate, lowerestimate, measureid
FROM readmissions_formatted
ORDER BY measureid;

Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?
